#### Exercise 1: 
The max_bright and min_bright values we found are 50000 and 1000 respectively.

#### Exercise 2:

#### Exercise 3: 
The average, minimum, maximum response time for 10 flashes total was 325.4, 292, and 413 respectively.

The cloud service we choose was Google Sheets, a spreadsheets application hosted on the Google Cloud Platform. 

A response time data is automically written after each gamex and can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10I4hWM1wM2KadfKFO0Cm7seso-7uP6tUOPUhtQwwiwA/edit?usp=sharing)

Additionally, we used built an API using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/deploying/) and a hosting platform called [Render](https://render.com/)
