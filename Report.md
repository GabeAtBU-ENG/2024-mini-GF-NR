#### Exercise 1: 
The max_bright and min_bright values we found are 50000 and 1000 respectively.

#### Exercise 2:
We choose the starwars Imperial March.

#### Exercise 3: 
The average, minimum, maximum response time for 10 flashes total was 325.4, 292, and 413 respectively.

As can be seen below, cloud service we choose was Google Sheets, a spreadsheets application hosted on the Google Cloud Platform.

Additionally, for extra credit we use github actions for Continous Integration by configuring [workflows.yml](https://github.com/GabeAtBU-ENG/2024-mini-GF-NR/blob/main/assignment/workflow.yml) to build and deploy our code

A response time data is automically written after each gamex and can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10I4hWM1wM2KadfKFO0Cm7seso-7uP6tUOPUhtQwwiwA/edit?usp=sharing)

Additionally, we used built an API using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/deploying/) and a hosting platform called [Render](https://render.com/)
